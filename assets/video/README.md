# Welcome Video

Place your welcome screen background video here.

## File Requirements

- **Filename**: `welcome-placeholder.mp4`
- **Location**: `/assets/video/welcome-placeholder.mp4`
- **Resolution**: 1080p or 720p (optimized for mobile)
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (should loop seamlessly)
- **Content**: Cycling/biking footage that represents the NaBajk brand
- **File Size**: Keep under 10MB if possible for fast loading

## Video Optimization Tips

1. Use a video compression tool to reduce file size while maintaining quality
2. Ensure the video loops seamlessly (first and last frames should match)
3. Test on both iOS and Android devices
4. Consider different screen aspect ratios (16:9, 19.5:9, etc.)

## Fallback Behavior

If the video file is missing or fails to load, the app will automatically fall back to a dark gradient background. The app will not crash.

## Testing

After adding your video:
1. Restart the Expo dev server
2. Test the auth-welcome screen
3. Verify the video loops smoothly
4. Check that text remains readable over the video
